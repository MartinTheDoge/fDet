These sights are equipped with first focal plane \"FinnDot\" reticles (a regular mil-dot reticle with the addition of holdover [[Stadiametric_rangefinding|(stadiametric) rangefinding]] brackets for 1 metre high or 0.5 metre wide targets at 400, 600, 800, 1,000 and 1,200 m).

The reticle elevation has 0.25 [[Angular_mil|mil]] (0.25 [[Milliradian|mrad]]) adjustment intervals (total elevation range = 18.6 mils), while the windage has 0.1 mil adjustment intervals. The FDF believes 0.25 mil elevation intervals are easier and quicker to use with Arctic mittens and that the difference between 0.1 and 0.25 mil adjustment intervals is negligible for anti-personnel sniping (0.1 mil at 1,400 m = 14 cm (0.3437747 [[Minute_of_angle|MOA]]), 0.25 mil at 1,400 m = 35 cm (0.8594367 MOA)).
